# StateMod #

This folder contains files that should be copied to the StateMod dataset.
Using a Git repository for each dataset means that a `../StateMod` folder is local to the StateCU repository unless naming conventions for StateMod repository folder can be standardized.

***Need to evaluate how the StateCU files are shared with StateMod dataset when using Git repositories.***
